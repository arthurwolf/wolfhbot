Wolf HBot
============

A large build volume 3d printer based on the HBot (CoreXY) concept.

The plans are use 2020 Misumi extrusions for most of the frame.

* The XY carriages will run on the extrusions on Steve Grabers Universal W Wheels.
* The drive will use #25 Roller chain.
* The Z bed lifting mechanism will be a scissor Jack arrangement.
* build volume is around 400x400x300 mm


Currently using line driven, and just XY moves...
