Wolf HBot
============

A large build volume 3d printer based on the HBot (CoreXY) concept.

The plans are use 2020 Misumi extrusions for most of the frame.

* The XY carriages will run on the extrusions on Steve Grabers Universal W Wheels.
* The drive will use #25 Roller chain.
* The Z bed lifting mechanism will be a scissor Jack arrangement.
* build volume is around 400x400x300 mm


Currently using line driven, and just XY moves...

* [Drawing big circle](http://youtu.be/9L7iuisqjXY)

Idlers were PLA printed V idlers, but they didn;t seem to be very good
with tight spectra, so I made some simple collars that go on both ends
of the bearing so the spectra runs on the metal bearing surface, it's
much better.

Still have a little lateral motion in Y direction when X is moving,
need to tighten things up.
